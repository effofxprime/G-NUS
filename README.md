# G'NUS
 Pronounced "Genius", G"NUS(Not another update script) is a Python based auto updater script for Cosmos Ecosystem Validators

No release yet, still working on converting it from my bash version called "Cosmos scriptvisor".

Be sure to follow for updates when the first release comes out!  The goal is to have this do so much more than the current options.

Auto-compile
Auto-downloads
priv state backups
checks to avoid double signing
discord notifications
... And MOAR!
